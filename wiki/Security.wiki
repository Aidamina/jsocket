=Security=




= Flash =

Flash has some pretty aggressive socket permission systems.
All these systems take place server side and thus are not in the scope of this project.
That said, i do provide you with an example policy file:

Don't forget that this leaves your server open for requests from every flash application so it should only be used in development.
