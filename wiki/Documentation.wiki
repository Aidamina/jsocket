==Constructor==

=== jSocket() ===
Contructor of our jSocket Object. 
Internal id registration takes place here.


==Methods==

===jSocket.setup(target)===
Call this method to setup the socket. [jSocket.setup] takes the required argument target, which should contain a [http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors jQuery Selector] that points to a container where jSocket will place the flash file in. After the DOM has updated and the flash file has loaded, it will fire [jSocket.onReady].

===jSocket.connect(host, port)===
Call this method to connect to a listening socket. Method takes two required arguments, host which should be a host name or a valid ip address to connect to, and port to indicate which port we are connecting on. Once the connection process has finished it will fire [jSocket.onConnect].

===jSocket.send(data)===
Call this method to send data over the socket connection. Method takes one required argument, which should contain the data that will be sent over the connection.

===jSocket.close()===
Call this method to close the socket connection. It's important to know that this will *not* trigger the [jSocket.onClose] event
